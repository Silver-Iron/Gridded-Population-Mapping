# Gridded-Population-Mapping
All codes for my paper on the susceptibility of Asian populations to sea level rise
I used the highly detailed gridded world population dataset from the the WorldPop Project
Together with several spatial and topographical map layers, I estimated the number of people whowould be affected by a rise of sea level in the future.
Moreover, I also used the Global Rural-Urban mapping of Columbia University-CIESIN to explore urban dynamism in the affected areas.
